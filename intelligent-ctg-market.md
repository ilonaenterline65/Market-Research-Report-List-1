<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent CTG Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Cardiotocography</li><li>Internal Cardiotocography</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent CTG market comprises two primary types: external cardiotocography (ECTG) and internal cardiotocography (ICTG). ECTG involves the use of external sensors placed on the mother’s abdomen to monitor fetal heart rate and uterine contractions, providing a non-invasive assessment. In contrast, ICTG employs internal devices inserted into the uterus to obtain more precise measurements of fetal heart activity and uterine pressure. Both methods are crucial for monitoring fetal well-being during pregnancy and labor, enhancing clinical decision-making and outcomes.</p></p>
