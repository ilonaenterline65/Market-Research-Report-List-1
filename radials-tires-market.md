<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Radials Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Black</li><li>Non-marking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Radial tires feature layers of fabric cords running radially across the tire, offering better grip, durability, and fuel efficiency. In the market, radial tires are categorized into black and non-marking types. Black tires, made with carbon black, are standard for most vehicles, providing strength and longevity. Non-marking tires, often used in indoor or clean environments, lack carbon black, preventing scuff marks on floors. Both types cater to specific needs, balancing performance, aesthetics, and application requirements.</p></p>
