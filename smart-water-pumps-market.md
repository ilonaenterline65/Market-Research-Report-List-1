<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smart water pumps market comprises primarily two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water, making them ideal for high flow applications and efficient in handling large volumes. They rely on the conversion of energy from a motor to kinetic energy in the fluid. In contrast, positive displacement pumps move water by trapping a fixed volume and forcing it through the discharge, providing consistent flow and pressure, making them suitable for applications requiring precise dosing or handling viscous fluids.</p></p>
