<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Blacks for Rubber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Black</li><li>Furnace Black</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon blacks for rubber are categorized primarily into two types: thermal black and furnace black. Thermal black is produced through the thermal decomposition of hydrocarbons in a low-oxygen environment, leading to a coarser structure and higher purity, generally used in specific applications like specialty rubber products. In contrast, furnace black is generated through the combustion of hydrocarbons in a controlled environment, resulting in finer particles and superior reinforcement properties, making it the most commonly used type in tires and other rubber goods.</p></p>
