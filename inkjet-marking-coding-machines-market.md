<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Inkjet Marking Coding Machines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CIJ</li><li>DOD</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Inkjet marking coding machines are primarily categorized into two types: Continuous Inkjet (CIJ) and Drop-On-Demand (DOD). CIJ machines continuously circulate ink, producing consistent marks at high speeds, making them ideal for large-scale production environments. In contrast, DOD machines only eject ink droplets when needed, allowing for precise marking and the capability to print on uneven surfaces. Both technologies are essential in various industries for labeling, product coding, and providing information on packaging efficiently.</p></p>
