<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Permanent IVC Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Tethered Filter</li><li>Unrestricted-type Filter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Permanent IVC filter market consists of two main types: tethered filters and unrestricted-type filters. Tethered filters are designed to remain permanently within the inferior vena cava, offering reliable thrombus prevention while being anchored for stability. Unrestricted-type filters, on the other hand, provide more flexibility in placement and can adapt to varying patient anatomies. Both types aim to prevent pulmonary embolism by capturing thrombi, but they differ in design and functionality to suit individual patient needs.</p></p>
