<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Fly Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single mass flywheel</li><li>Dual mass flywheel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The automotive flywheel market is divided into two primary types: single mass flywheels and dual mass flywheels. Single mass flywheels are simpler, more lightweight, and cost-effective, providing direct power transfer but can transmit vibrations and noise. In contrast, dual mass flywheels feature two separate masses connected by a spring mechanism, which dampens vibrations and enhances engine smoothness, making them ideal for modern, high-torque engines. These variations cater to different performance needs and vehicle applications.</p></p>
