<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Incinerators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Counter Current Rotary Incinerators</li><li>Co-Current Rotary Incinerators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rotary incinerators market is primarily divided into two types: counter-current and co-current rotary incinerators. Counter-current rotary incinerators allow waste to enter the chamber opposite to the flow of combustion gases, promoting efficient heat transfer and complete combustion. In contrast, co-current rotary incinerators have waste and gases flowing in the same direction, which can simplify design and operation but may lead to less effective combustion. Both types are used for waste treatment, with distinct advantages depending on specific application requirements.</p></p>
