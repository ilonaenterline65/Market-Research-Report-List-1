<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Braking Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drum Brake</li><li>Disc Brake</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial vehicle braking systems market includes two primary types: drum brakes and disc brakes. Drum brakes use brake shoes that press outward against a rotating drum to create friction and slow the vehicle. They are cost-effective and durable, often used in heavy-duty applications. Disc brakes utilize brake pads that clamp onto a rotor, offering superior heat dissipation and consistent performance, especially in high-speed or frequent braking scenarios. Both systems are essential for safety, with disc brakes increasingly favored for their efficiency and reliability.</p></p>
